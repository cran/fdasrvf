# fdasrvf 2.0.3
* exposed lam to curve functions
* added gamma to shooting vector conversion functions
* bugfixes

# fdasrvf 2.0.2

* added dynamic grid to DP method (#25)
* update outputs to curve functions (#26)
* extend exp_map to n-d curves (#27)
* bugfixes

# fdasrvf 2.0.1

* Added functionalities to `kmeans_align()` (#24). Specifically:

  - it gains the argument `use_verbose` which allows the user to suppress 
  information displayed in the console;
  - it includes a numeric vector storing the distances to corresponding center 
  for each curve in the output;
  - it is now possible to use the *medoid* as centroid type as an alternative to 
  the mean; the medoid is the most central curve among the existing curves.

* Further small improvements, documentation updates and improved code coverage 
(#23).

# fdasrvf 2.0.0

* Added multivariate kmeans (#18);
* Added additional penalties to warping and additional outputs exposed to 
`bootTB()` (#19);
* Switch from travis appveyor to GHA for CI and code coverage monitoring (#20);
* Bugfixes and documentation updates.
